# Diabetes Mellitus Risk Prediction and Recommendation System

## Overview

Diabetes mellitus is a global health challenge that significantly impacts quality of life. Early detection and accurate risk prediction are critical to effective management. Traditional diagnostic methods, though effective, often face limitations due to the high cost and the unavailability of comprehensive clinical markers. In contrast, machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising alternative, with demonstrated potential for higher accuracy.

## Project Description

This project explores various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression, to predict diabetes risk. The models are trained on datasets that incorporate lifestyle, clinical, and demographic factors, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.9%, which surpasses traditional diagnostic methods. Additionally, the integration of ML with wearables and electronic health records (EHR) is investigated to facilitate personalized and real-time risk assessments.

## Features

- **ML Algorithms:** Utilizes SVM, Logistic Regression, and other ML techniques for diabetes risk prediction.
- **Accuracy:** Achieves a prediction accuracy of 77.9%, with enhanced sensitivity and specificity.
- **Data Integration:** Incorporates lifestyle, clinical, and demographic data, along with potential integration with wearables and EHRs.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient Diabetes Recommendation System that leverages advanced ML techniques for early detection and personalized health management.
